    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be deplayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;font-weight: bold;">Css is not neccesary</span> <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control a layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li><br>
        <li>Internal by using a style element in the head section </li><br>
        <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li><br>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple  elements. ID, on the other hand , applies to style to one unique element.ID is also special in that u can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.

    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.

    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
